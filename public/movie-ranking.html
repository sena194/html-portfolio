<h3>Tresure Planet</h3>
<p>My go-to comfort movie. It makes me feel better when i got anxiety about my future. Makes me feel the power that i had in me.</p>
<h3>1994</h3>
<p>It's adapted from the novel with the same name. And has distopian themed undertones in it.</p>
<h3>Howl's moving castle</h3>
<p>One of the best works of Studio Ghibli. A classic without a doubt.</p>
